Write a shell script modify with the following syntax: 
- modify [-r] [-l|-u] <dir/filenames...>  
- modify [-r] <sed pattern><dir/file names...>  
- modify [-h]    
- modify_examples

which will modify file names. The script is dedicated to lowerizing (-l) file names, uppercasing (-u) file names
or internally calling sed command with the given sed pattern which will operate on file names. Changes may be done
either with recursion (-r) or without it. Write asecond script, named modify_examples, which will lead the tester of
the modify script through the typical, uncommon and even incorrect scenarios ofusage of the modify script.
